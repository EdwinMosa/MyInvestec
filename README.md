# MyInvestec Project 

Please create a C# console application as follows.

The program will ask the user to enter text, followed by asking the user which operations to perform on the inputted text. It will only support the following three operations:
1.	Duplicate check – Represented by a ‘1’ 
2.	Count the number of unique vowels – Represented by ‘2’
3.	Output if there are more unique vowels or unique non vowels – Represented by ‘3’
The three possible operations work as follows :
1.	Duplicates Check
a.	If supplied ‘I like eating apples’ then the output should be Found the following duplicates: ileap
b.	If supplied ‘abcd4’ then the output should be No duplicate values were found
2.	Count the number of vowels
a.	If supplied ‘I like eating apples’ then the sample output should be The number of vowels is 3
b.	If supplied ‘jkl kkjh’ then the sample output should be No vowels were found.
3.	Output if there are more vowels or non vowels
a.	If supplied with ‘I eat’ then the output should be The text has more vowels than non vowels
b.	If supplied with ‘that dog’ then the output should be The text has more non vowels than vowels
c.	If supplied with ‘3 a’ then the output should be The text has an equal amount of vowels and non vowels
Here is an example of how your program could be used and how it should respond:
The program opens up a console and displays Enter text to be analysed
The user enters ‘I like to eat apples’
The program responds Enter which operations to do on the supplied text, ‘1’ for a duplicate character check, ‘2’ to count the number of vowels, ‘3’ to check if there are more vowels or non vowels, or any combination of ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ to perform multiple checks.

The user enters ‘12’

The program responds
Found the following duplicates: iletap
The number of vowels is 4
Please note that when performing the 3 operations, case is not important, and neither are empty string values.
Input validation is not required.
You will not only be assessed based on whether or not your program works, you will also be assessed on how you solve the problem. 
Please provide unit tests and write the code as cleanly as possible.
Please keep the code open for extension but closed for modification; allow for future operations (other than the existing 3) to be done on the inputted string with minimal impact to the code.
You may email us your code, but if you do, please do not include any dlls. You may also upload your code to GitHub and provide us with a link to the code.
